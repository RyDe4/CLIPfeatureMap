\title{Generate a Pie Chart of The percentage of ChIP peak nucleotides that
are methylated}
\usage{
plotMethylPercentage(methylOverlapData)
}
\arguments{
\item{methylOverlapData}{a data frame with a coverage column specifying
the percentage of reads methylated. This column must be named coverage}
}
\value{
returns a pie plot of methylation percentages
}
\description{
Using the dataframe of methylation data for ChIP peak nucleotides
generated by getMethylOverlap, create a pie chart showing the
percentage of peak sites that are methylated
}
\examples{
system.file("extdata", "MAZ_high_score.bed", package = "ChIPAnalyzer")
system.file("extdata", "HcfUMethylData.bed", package = "ChIPAnalyzer")
overlap <- getMethylOverlap("MAZ_high_score.bed", "HcfUMethylData.bed")
plotMethylPercentage(overlap)
